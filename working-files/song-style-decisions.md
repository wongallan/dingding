- Final lyric rendering: Retained declarative chant structure (`Invincible great butlers...`) while normalizing noisy OCR tokens into coherent service-themed lyric lines.

- Scene/Song: Scene 03 quarantine panic song segment (`管家慌亂歌`, page 13)
- Source phrase: fragmented symptom-and-duty panic lines under emergency isolation announcement.
- Literal meaning: Butlers fear infection, inability to serve, and loss of control during quarantine.

- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Prioritize dramatic urgency and service-duty stakes while avoiding over-creative reconstruction of unreadable tokens; uncertainty is tracked in extraction notes for potential re-OCR refinement.

- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Preserve refrain-driven singability and comedic stress tone; prioritize repeated semantic anchors over speculative word-level reconstruction in low-confidence OCR zones.
