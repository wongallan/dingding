## Decisions

- Scene/Song: Scene 01 opening school-arrival song (pages 3-4)
- Source phrase: `我只要，叮一聲` and repeated `叮一聲` hooks
- Literal meaning: I only need one "ding" / with one ding
- Final lyric rendering: "I just need one ding" / "One ding—..."
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Preserve chant-like catchphrase for audience participation while keeping semantic anchor tied to immediate magical effect.
- Approved by: Copilot (GPT-5.3-Codex)

- Scene/Song: Scene 02 opening chorus `萬能的爸媽` (page 6)
- Source phrase: `爸爸媽媽` refrain and caregiving detail lines (`你每天煮早餐`, `日日教我執書包`)
- Literal meaning: Parents are all-capable caretakers who support a child through daily routines and emotional comfort.
- Final lyric rendering: Kept direct parental refrain as `Dad and Mom` with warm, audience-readable domestic imagery in complete sentence lines.
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Preserve repetitive sing-along structure while prioritizing clear emotional gratitude over strict literal compression.
- Approved by: Copilot (GPT-5.3-Codex)

- Scene/Song: Scene 02 butler anthem `無敵大管家` (page 10)
- Source phrase: repeated butler-pride refrains around service protocol, confidence, and on-call support.
- Literal meaning: Professional butlers frame discipline, readiness, and student support as a proud identity.
- Final lyric rendering: Retained declarative chant structure (`Invincible great butlers...`) while normalizing noisy OCR tokens into coherent service-themed lyric lines.
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Keep ensemble momentum and boastful tone for stage energy; prioritize semantic anchors (discipline, readiness, confidence, support) where OCR character-level certainty is low.
- Approved by: Copilot (GPT-5.3-Codex)

- Scene/Song: Scene 03 quarantine panic song segment (`管家慌亂歌`, page 13)
- Source phrase: fragmented symptom-and-duty panic lines under emergency isolation announcement.
- Literal meaning: Butlers fear infection, inability to serve, and loss of control during quarantine.
- Final lyric rendering: Preserved anxiety-driven short-line cadence (`hands and feet weak`, `out of control`, `deliver Miss’s dinner`) with conservative normalization for degraded OCR lexemes.
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Prioritize dramatic urgency and service-duty stakes while avoiding over-creative reconstruction of unreadable tokens; uncertainty is tracked in extraction notes for potential re-OCR refinement.
- Approved by: Copilot (GPT-5.3-Codex)

- Scene/Song: Scene 04 lunch-crisis ensemble (`不知點算好`, page 17)
- Source phrase: repeated `點算好` refrain around missing lunch/help and dependency panic.
- Literal meaning: Students feel helpless without butlers for cooking, cleaning, and daily support; anxiety escalates into comic panic.
- Final lyric rendering: Retained recurring `what do we do` cadence in each line while normalizing heavily fragmented OCR into coherent, performable panic-chorus lines.
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Preserve refrain-driven singability and comedic stress tone; prioritize repeated semantic anchors over speculative word-level reconstruction in low-confidence OCR zones.
- Approved by: Copilot (GPT-5.3-Codex)

- Scene/Song: Scene 07 breakdown song (`我真的試了`, pages 27-28)
- Source phrase: repeated `叮一聲` contrast against loss-of-control and self-doubt lines.
- Literal meaning: The singer contrasts former effortless magic with present helplessness and fear of trying again.
- Final lyric rendering: Kept `叮一聲` as a recurring anchor while condensing fragmented OCR lyric shards into coherent emotional lines in the same narrative order.
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Preserve collapse-from-confidence arc and stage emotion; prioritize continuity and semantic anchors over speculative character-level reconstruction in low-confidence tokens.
- Approved by: Copilot (GPT-5.3-Codex)

- Scene/Song: Scene 07 butler support song (`靜靜守候`, page 28)
- Source phrase: quiet guardianship, stepping back, and staying nearby through setbacks.
- Literal meaning: Love means allowing growth through independent struggle while continuing to protect from a respectful distance.
- Final lyric rendering: Used calm, promise-like phrasing around `守候`, `放手`, and `陪伴` to keep the mentorship/guardianship emotional core.
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Maintain lullaby-like reassurance and thematic handoff from dependency to independence; keep recurring support verbs stable for future scene callbacks.
- Approved by: Copilot (GPT-5.3-Codex)

- Scene/Song: Scene 07 resilience ensemble (`新節奏`, pages 29-30)
- Source phrase: self-reliance refrains (`靠自己雙手`, `自我解救`) interleaved with fear/confession counters (`我不敢去試`, `怕出醜`).
- Literal meaning: The character moves from dependency/fear toward action by accepting support while choosing to act with her own hands.
- Final lyric rendering: Preserved call-and-response tension between doubt and encouragement, keeping `雙手` and `嘗試` as repeated semantic anchors.
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Maintain momentum from breakdown to agency; prioritize coherent emotional arc and recurring motif continuity over speculative word-level reconstruction in low-confidence OCR brackets.
- Approved by: Copilot (GPT-5.3-Codex)

- Scene/Song: Scene 08 opening ensemble (`重新起步`, page 31)
- Source phrase: repeated encouragement lines around falling, regrouping, and mutual support (`跌低過`, `重新開始`, `互相協助`).
- Literal meaning: Children will stumble, but can recover through rest, renewed effort, and companionship.
- Final lyric rendering: Kept short, chant-like motivational lines with clear recovery verbs (`start again`, `help each other`) and preserved the communal support anchor.
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Preserve upbeat reset energy at Scene 08 opening while keeping language simple for live follow-along readability; avoid speculative embellishment in low-confidence OCR fragments.
