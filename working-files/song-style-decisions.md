## Decisions

- Scene/Song: Scene 01 opening school-arrival song (pages 3-4)
- Source phrase: `我只要，叮一聲` and repeated `叮一聲` hooks
- Literal meaning: I only need one "ding" / with one ding
- Final lyric rendering: "I just need one ding" / "One ding—..."
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Preserve chant-like catchphrase for audience participation while keeping semantic anchor tied to immediate magical effect.
- Approved by: Copilot (GPT-5.3-Codex)

- Scene/Song: Scene 02 opening chorus `萬能的爸媽` (page 6)
- Source phrase: `爸爸媽媽` refrain and caregiving detail lines (`你每天煮早餐`, `日日教我執書包`)
- Literal meaning: Parents are all-capable caretakers who support a child through daily routines and emotional comfort.
- Final lyric rendering: Kept direct parental refrain as `Dad and Mom` with warm, audience-readable domestic imagery in complete sentence lines.
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Preserve repetitive sing-along structure while prioritizing clear emotional gratitude over strict literal compression.
- Approved by: Copilot (GPT-5.3-Codex)

- Scene/Song: Scene 02 butler anthem `無敵大管家` (page 10)
- Source phrase: repeated butler-pride refrains around service protocol, confidence, and on-call support.
- Literal meaning: Professional butlers frame discipline, readiness, and student support as a proud identity.
- Final lyric rendering: Retained declarative chant structure (`Invincible great butlers...`) while normalizing noisy OCR tokens into coherent service-themed lyric lines.
- Rationale (meter, tone, audience clarity, artistic intent): Keep ensemble momentum and boastful tone for stage energy; prioritize semantic anchors (discipline, readiness, confidence, support) where OCR character-level certainty is low.
