# Scene Synopsis

One paragraph per scene describing what happens. Link each synopsis to its corresponding script file in `script/`.

- Scene 1 — At Love-Ding Fort Academy, Yiu-Yiu and classmates introduce their signature “Ding Ding Magic,” showing how one “ding” appears to solve daily needs instantly while establishing the school world, core cast, and playful confidence that magic can handle everything. ([Script](script/scene-01.md))
- Scene 2 — The story reveals the hidden system behind the “magic”: dedicated butlers performing constant support; as students and butlers debate what counts as real ability, dependence on service routines and privilege becomes a central tension. ([Script](script/scene-02.md))
- Scene 3 — During butler training and code review, pressure, complaints, and illness panic expose the fragility of a system where children rely on immediate service, and the butlers’ own stress raises doubts about whether this arrangement is sustainable. ([Script](script/scene-03.md))
- Scene 4 — When “Ding Ding Magic” fails and butlers are unavailable, students arrive disoriented and frustrated, confronting the first real consequences of not knowing basic self-care and beginning to face the gap between magical convenience and practical life skills. ([Script](script/scene-04.md))
- Scene 5 — At Mount Antrel camp, students and butlers struggle through cooking, tidying, and daily logistics without normal shortcuts, and rivalry gives way to repeated lessons that effort, mistakes, and cooperation are unavoidable parts of growing up. ([Script](script/scene-05.md))
- Scene 6 — As the annual “Love-Ding Honor” competition begins with knowledge and magic rounds, butlers are instructed to step back under “let-go training,” shifting the focus from perfect service toward student agency and fair challenge. ([Script](script/scene-06.md))
- Scene 7 — After setbacks and emotional collapse, Yiu-Yiu and classmates confront failure directly; with quiet support rather than rescue, they begin choosing practice over entitlement and learn that independence develops through repetition, not instant results. ([Script](script/scene-07.md))
- Scene 8 — Small but visible progress emerges: students pack bags, manage routines, and even cook for butlers, while the adults resist intervening too quickly; mutual respect deepens as both children and caregivers relearn their roles through patience. ([Script](script/scene-08.md))
- Scene 9 — In the finale, a missing “Love-Ding Honor” triggers a no-magic group problem-solving test that ends in accountability, reconciliation, and redefined awards, concluding that the strongest magic is love, courage, cooperation, and hands-on action. ([Script](script/scene-09.md))
