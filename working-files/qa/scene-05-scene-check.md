- Date: 2026-02-14
- Agent: Copilot (GPT-5.3-Codex)
- Source pages: 18-21
- Target script file: `booklet/script/scene-05.md`

## Scope Covered

- Section 01: page 18
- Section 02: pages 19-20
- Section 03: page 21

## Checks

1. Completeness check
- Section 01 extracted lines: 15
- Section 02 extracted lines: 57
- Section 03 extracted lines: 46
- Total extracted lines: 118
- Total written triplets in Scene 05: 118
- Result: PASS

2. Order and boundary check
- Intra-scene sequence preserved from opening camp dialogue through Scene 05 closing beat.
- Scene boundary ownership validated: page 22 (`第六幕`) excluded from Scene 05.
- Result: PASS

3. Consistency check
- Character naming and key family terms are consistent with working maps/glossary.
- Mixed-language style tokens retained consistently where source uses them.
- Result: PASS (with OCR confidence caveat)

4. Format check
- Scene file maintains strict three-line triplet format for every entry.
- Result: PASS

5. Exclusion check
- Stage directions and movement cues remain excluded from script entries.
- Result: PASS

## Residual Risk Notes

- Lyric-heavy blocks on pages 20-21 include conservative lexical normalizations; optional targeted re-OCR remains a non-blocking hardening task.
